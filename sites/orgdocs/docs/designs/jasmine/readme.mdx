## Designer Notes {#notes}

This pattern works differently from most on freesewing. Because it's made to fit a dog, it doesn't
make sense to use freesewing's human measurements sets, and because dogs tend to be squirmy and
not fond of being measured, requiring a full set of fine-grained measurements in order to generate
the pattern at all might be troublesome.

Instead, all the fit settings for this pattern cascade. If the only measurement you can get off your
dog is their chest circumference, set only first -> Chest Circumference to match and leave all the
others at defaults. This will give you a pattern sized to fit the designer's dog, but linearly
scaled to match the chest of yours.

Ideally, try to get your dog's chest cirumference, collar circumference, and back length, in that
order of importance. To fine-tune the shape of the armhole, there are also options for the
collar-to-chest and shoulder-to-shoulder measurements. Those are harder to measure on a dog
with precision, but if you leave them at 100% each, the pattern's scaling for the back length
and chest circumference alone should place the armhole properly for most dogs.

## What You Need {#needs}

To make Jasmine, you will need:

- A single piece of fabric big enough to cut out the coat piece on the fold
- Something for the closure on the front and belly
  -- Hook-and-loop closures (aka velcro) are good for this, but you can try snaps or buttons
  if you feel bold or they're what you have on hand
- Optional: Enough bias tape to go around the edges
- Optional: A bit of extra fabric for the back pocket,
  in either a matching or contrasting color

## Fabric Options {#fabric}

Pick something warm and sturdy enough to hold up to being on your dog. Depending on your dog's
propensity for mess, it might be a good idea to pick something easily washable and dark
enough not to show stains. No stretch is necessary, but it won't hurt.

The simplest fabric choice here is fleece. It's warm, it doesn't unravel at the edges, it's generally
sturdy enough. For a raincoat, you might want something waterproof.
